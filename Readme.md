## About

In the process of preparing for technical interviews and enhancing my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms, I created this repository to organize and document the Java programs I practiced. Each program focuses on a specific concept, algorithm, or problem-solving technique.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **/Arrays**: Contains Java programs related to array manipulation, searching, and sorting algorithms.
- **/LinkedLists**: Includes Java implementations of various types of linked lists and related problems.
- **/Trees**: Consists of Java programs related to binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal algorithms.
- **/Sorting**: Contains Java implementations of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **/Searching**: Includes Java programs for searching algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
- **/DynamicProgramming**: Consists of Java implementations of dynamic programming algorithms and problems.
- **/Graphs**: Contains Java programs related to graph data structure and graph algorithms.
- **/Strings**: Includes Java programs related to string manipulation and string algorithms.

## List of Programs

Here's a list of some key programs available in this repository:

1. **Binary Search**: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
2. **Merge Sort**: Implementation of the merge sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
3. **Linked List Reversal**: Program to reverse a singly linked list.
4. **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Implementation of DFS algorithm for traversing graphs.
